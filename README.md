# **Balloon Adventure Game**

## **Overview**

This project is a 2D game developed in Unity where the player controls a balloon floating through a town, collecting tokens while avoiding explosives. The balloon continuously floats upwards when the player holds down the **spacebar**, while a scrolling background simulates movement. The game features random spawning of bombs and money tokens, with particle and sound effects for interactions. The project involved applying knowledge of physics, scrolling backgrounds, and special effects, as well as extensive troubleshooting to resolve various errors.

## **Features**

- **Balloon Control:** The balloon floats upwards as long as the player holds the **spacebar**.
- **Scrolling Background:** The background seamlessly repeats, creating the illusion of continuous upward movement.
- **Random Object Spawning:** Bombs and money tokens spawn randomly on a timer, adding dynamic challenges and rewards.
- **Collision Effects:**
  - **Money Tokens:** When the balloon collides with a money token, a particle effect is triggered, and a sound plays.
  - **Bombs:** When the balloon collides with a bomb, an explosion effect occurs, the game ends, and the background stops scrolling.
